# Kohi

A very minimal spec framework to run primarily in the browser without any dependencies. Since this tool is built for modern ES6 browser environment it should work in a NodeJs context as well. The goal is to have a kohi test from the `/bench` folder run in under `100ms`. Kohi uses the [String Spec](https://kotest.io/docs/framework/testing-styles.html#string-spec) style of writing specs.


## NOTE

- The reporter has to work in CI / CD pipelines. 
  - This means proxy servers and other sub servers will not work
  - The frontend must generate a report in JSON to post to the CI / CD pipeline
  - The CI / CD pipeline then takes the result and saves it to `/coverage` folder
  - The CI / CD pipeline should then generate a report from the `/coverage` folder
  - Maybe the `vite build` command might help with this?
